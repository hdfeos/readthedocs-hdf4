====

The HDF stands for Hierarchical Data Format.
The 4 stands for version 4.
The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) implements a model for
managing and storing data.
The model includes an abstract data model,
an abstract storage model (a.k.a. the data format),
and libraries to implement the abstract model and
to map the storage model to different storage mechanisms.
